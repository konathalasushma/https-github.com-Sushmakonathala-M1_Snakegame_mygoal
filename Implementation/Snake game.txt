# Introduction
Snake Game is the classic video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane.

As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves.

In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head.

The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, other obstacle, or itself.

# History of the game
The Snake design dates back to the arcade game Blockade, developed and published by Gremlin in 1976. It was cloned as Bigfoot Bonkers the same year. In 1977, Atari, released two Blockade-inspired titles: the arcade game Dominos and Atari VCS game Surround. Surround was one of the nine Atari VCS launch titles in the US and was sold by Sears under the name Chase. That same year, a similar game was launched for the Bally Astrocade as Checkmate.

Snake II was launched with Nokia’s 3310 in 2000 and it became an entire generation’s obsession. The snake wasn’t just a line anymore, but had a proper form, there were bonuses and the screen was cyclical, allowing one to go through the bottom of the screen and come back out the top. In India and across the world, kids were hooked, eagerly competing for the highest score whether they were lying in bed, pretending to study in class or sitting at a café. Draining a phone’s battery and earning the wrath of exasperated teachers was just collateral damage. An addictively simple game, Snake was launched, in its mobile phone avatar, in 1997 with the Nokia 6110 — you remember, the blue candy bar-shaped model with a single antenna

Swot Analysis
Strengths
Snake is a classic game that requires players to assess their surroundings and find the quickest or safest route to a point. This is an excellent opportunity to learn about spatial awareness and plan ahead to your next move.

The classic game is infamous for using your own success against you when you become so long that you get in your own way. Whilst many games and activities can teach your child about vital life skills, there are not many that would educate on long term strategic planning.

As many parents will know, it can be extremely frustrating to reach such a high level and then lose as you crash into your own tail. The game requires patience in order to grow and a cool head once you inevitably lose. These are all valuable skills to learn early on in a child’s life that will benefit them in later years.

Snake is a tool that can be used as an educational helping hand. One of the important parts of learning is that you will never get something right the first time. Snake teaches children that practice makes perfect when it comes to learning new skills.
