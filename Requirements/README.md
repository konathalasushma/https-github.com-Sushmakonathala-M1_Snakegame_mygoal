# # Introduction


Snake Game is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane.

As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. 

In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. 

The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, other obstacle, or itself.

Snake game is a classic computer action game, in which we control a snake to move and collect food in a map.

Which has been arround since the earliest days of home computing, and has re-emerged in recent years on mobile phones
it isn't world's greatest game, but it does give you an idea of what you can achieve with relatively simple c program, and perhaps the basis by which to extend the principles.
it can create more intresting games of your own.


# How to play?
The game environment is a 30030 map. The snake starts with length one. 

At each time step the snake moves one step, and it can go straight, turn left, or turn right

 The snake hits its own body or the wall, The length of the snake gets zero, The game score gets negative.
 
 The Main aim of the game is to collect the dots(Food) and avoid the obstacles (boarders, crosses, and the snake itself).
 As  you collect the food, the snake gets longer , so increasing your likelihood of crashing into yourself. when you collected enough food, you progress into the next level, where your snake gets larger.
 
 you get scored according to the length of the snake and the no. of 'x' obstacles in the screen. The speed increases every 5 levels.
 you get a bonus when you complete the level of 1000.

 
# # History of the game
 
The Snake design dates back to the arcade game Blockade, developed and published by Gremlin in 1976. It was cloned as Bigfoot Bonkers the same year. In 1977, Atari, released two Blockade-inspired titles: the arcade game Dominos and Atari VCS game Surround.
Surround was one of the nine Atari VCS launch titles in the US and was sold by Sears under the name Chase. That same year, a similar game was launched for the Bally Astrocade as Checkmate.

The first known home computer version, titled Worm, was programmed in 1978 by Peter Trefonas for the TRS-80, and published by CLOAD magazine in the same year. This was followed shortly afterwards with versions from the same author for the Commodore PET and Apple II. A clone of the Hustle arcade game, itself a clone of Blockade, was written by Peter Trefonas in 1979 and published by CLOAD.

An authorized version of Hustle was published by Milton Bradley for the TI-99/4A in 1980. The single-player Snake Byte was published in 1982 for Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, and VIC-20 

A snake eats apples to complete a level, growing longer in the process. In Snake for the BBC Micro (1982), by Dave Bresnen, the snake is controlled using the left and right arrow keys relative to the direction it is heading in. The snake increases in speed as it gets longer, and there's only one life.

# Hidden Benefits
Snake is a classic game that requires players to assess their surroundings and find the quickest or safest route to a point. This is an excellent opportunity to learn about spatial awareness and plan ahead to your next move.

The classic game is infamous for using your own success against you when you become so long that you get in your own way. Whilst many games and activities can teach your child about vital life skills, there are not many that would educate on long term strategic planning.

As many parents will know, it can be extremely frustrating to reach such a high level and then lose as you crash into your own tail. The game requires patience in order to grow and a cool head once you inevitably lose. These are all valuable skills to learn early on in a child’s life that will benefit them in later years.

Snake is a tool that can be used as an educational helping hand. One of the important parts of learning is that you will never get something right the first time. Snake teaches children that practice makes perfect when it comes to learning new skills.
