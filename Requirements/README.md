#Introduction
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. 
The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, other obstacle, or itself.
Snake game is a classic computer action game, in which we control a snake to move and collect food in a map.
Which has been arround since the earliest days of home computing, and has re-emerged in recent years on mobile phones
it isn't world's greatest game, but it does give you an idea of what you can achieve with relatively simple c program, and perhaps the basis by which to extend the principles.
it can create more intresting games of your own.
Foods are provided at the several co-ordinates of the screen for the snake to eat. Every time the snake eats the food, its length will by increased by one element along with the score.
The game environment is a 30ï‚´30 map. The snake starts with length one. 
At each time step the snake moves one step, and it can go straight, turn left, or turn right
 The snake hits its own body or the wall, The length of the snake gets zero, The game score gets negative. The game score does not change after 900 time units.
 The Main aim of the game is to collect the dots(Food) and avoid the obstacles (boarders, crosses, and the snake itself).
 As  you collect the food, the snake gets longer , so increasing your likelihood of crashing into yourself. when you collected enough food, you progress into the next level, where your snake gets larger.
 you get scored according to the length of the snake and the no. of 'x' obstacles in the screen. The speed increases every 5 levels. you get a bonus when you complete the level of 1000.
 There is no concept of lives once you hit an obstacle
